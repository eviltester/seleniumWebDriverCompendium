Notes from Webinar 8/feb/2013
=============================

The application under test is Tracks:

* http://getontracks.org/

I use an installation from bitnami:

* http://bitnami.org/stack/tracks

In the webinar I have it installed on a virtual machine. And the url for the tracks account is encoded in the TracksAccount object.

I created a default user called "user" with the password "password"
