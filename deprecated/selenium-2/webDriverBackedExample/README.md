WebDriver Backed Selenium Example
=================================

This sample code forms part of the Selenium 2 WebDriver API online training course.

http://courses.compendiumdev.co.uk/

Because the Selenium API has been deprecated by the Selenium WebDriver project,
I have moved the `WebDriverBackedSelenium` example into this separate public domain project.

This prevents deprecation warnings being shown in the output when a `mvn clean test`
is performed on the course sourcecode.
