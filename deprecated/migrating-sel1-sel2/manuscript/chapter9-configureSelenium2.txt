#  9 A Worked Example: Configure Selenium 2.0 

I downloaded the selenium sources jar from the Selenium site they are contained in the Selenium Client Drivers .zip download. 

The best documentation for Selenium 2 is the source code. 

So I took selenium-java-2.0b3-srcs.jar from the zip and added it to the libs folder. 

This way my codebase has fewer libs in it to manage because the main Selenium jar I use is the all-in-one jar it just doesn't have the source-in-it 

This is checked in as Revision 5 

##  9.1 Associate Selenium Source Code 

The selenium source is included in the checkout in the selenium-java-2.0b3-srcs.jar 

Although we are using the all-in-one build for the server, the `...srcs.jar` is included in the 'other' download for Selenium. But I have extracted it into the repo to make things easy. 

Then I have to link the source code in the workshop to the Selenium source code. 

In IDE link the workshop code to Selenium code in `libs\selenium-java-2.0b3-srcs.jar`

##  9.2 Viewing the full Selenium 2.0 Source Code 

If you want to you can checkout the full Selenium source code. 

You could import the Selenium java code into Eclipse to make it easy to browse the Selenium code. 

If you want you could do an 

`> Svn checkout http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/java/`

Or browse the Selenium 2.0 code online 

http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/#svn/trunk
