#  5 A Worked Example: Logistics 

##  5.1 Setup your environment 

To follow along with this tutorial. You will need to install some tools. 

* A Java IDE, because you will be writing Java code and running tests from the IDE 
    * Eclipse ([http://www.eclipse.org/](http://www.eclipse.org/)) 
    * NetBeans ([http://netbeans.org](http://netbeans.org)) 
    * IntelliJ IDEA ([http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)) 

* Subversion client either GUI or command line tools
    * You will need to checkout the source code for the workshop and (optionally) the sourcecode for Selenium. 
    * [http://subversion.apache.org/](http://subversion.apache.org/)
    * On Windows I use [http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/](http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/)
    * Or I install a full subversion setup via the visual svn server [http://www.visualsvn.com/server/](http://www.visualsvn.com/server/)

##  5.2 Download the workshop sourcecode 

Create a directory to store everything. 

* `...\workspace\advancing`

Checkout the workshop source code at revision 2 into the location on your disk 

`> svn checkout -r 2 http://svn3.xp-dev.com/svn/miration/trunk/`

You can see the command line format above. Or copy the url of the repository into TortoiseSVN [http://svn3.xp-dev.com/svn/migration/trunk/](http://svn3.xp-dev.com/svn/migration/trunk/)

Checkout revision 2 if you want to start at the beginning. You can always update to a different revision at any point. 

Import it into your IDE. 

Run the tests to make sure you have everything configured properly. 

You want the Selenium 1.0 jars in your build path at the start, not selenium-server-standalone-2.0b3.jar 

##  5.3 Run it from Ant 

Install ant ([http://ant.apache.org/](http://ant.apache.org/)) 

You can check that you have it installed by running 

`> ant -version`

There is a simple windows installer available from [http://wiki.apache.org/ant/AntOnWindows](http://wiki.apache.org/ant/AntOnWindows)

##  5.4 Import the Source into your IDE 

###  5.4.1 Eclipse 

###  5.4.2 IntelliJ 

###  5.4.3 NetBeans 

##  5.5 Start the application under test 

`Java -jar SimpleWebServer.jar`

##  5.6 Change the Build Path 

##  5.7 Run The Tests 

`Run CanVisitSiteTests.java`

##  5.8 Using Subversion to workthrough the examples 

'answer'  is referenced during the text 

After Checkout During workshop 

> svn revert * -R

`svn update -r`

During the workshop you can update the code base to the 'sample' answers at any time. 

Before I do that I do a "revert" to remove all my changes. So if you update as you go through (and you probably will) and you want to keep you code then copy it off somewhere. 

You are probably better off making notes than keeping all your code. 

The workshop source starts at revision 2, and this is code using the Selenium 1.0 server.
