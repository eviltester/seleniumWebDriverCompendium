## Automate Google Search

[automateGoogleSearch](https://github.com/eviltester/seleniumWebDriverCompendium/tree/main/automateGoogleSearch)

- was at `github.com / eviltester / automateGoogleSearch`
- this is the code for the Let's Automate Google Search videos
    - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrM2ELpRbbu7c9oZKG8IHNX41Yi20p4an
- updated on 20230729 to still use Selenium 3 but to handle changes to Google UI
- Remember - automating the Google UI is not a good My First Test exercise... and this code shows why.

## Automation Abstractions - Beyond Page Objects

[automationAbstractions](https://github.com/eviltester/seleniumWebDriverCompendium/tree/main/automationAbstractions)
